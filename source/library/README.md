## The Library ##

Here be dragons! This is where we put all our library dependencies.
If you want to use a new library, consider putting it here, so others
can use it as well.

### To include a JS library ###

```html
    <script src="/library/loop.js"></script>
```

### To include a CSS library ###

```html
    <link href="/library/canvas.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
```
